# Configuration

Every environment variable the stack reads, kept in step with
[`deploy/.env.example`](../../deploy/.env.example) as later issues add services that read
more of them (per `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s documentation-impact table).

Copy `deploy/.env.example` to `deploy/.env` and fill in real values before running
`docker compose -f deploy/compose.yml up`. `deploy/.env` is gitignored — never commit real
values (NFR-26).

| Variable | Read by | Default (`.env.example`) | Secret | Local dev value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `postgres` service | `nptc` | No | `nptc` is fine |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `postgres` service | `change-me` | Yes | Any local-only value |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `postgres` service | `nptc` | No | `nptc` is fine |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `postgres` service (host port mapping) | `5432` | No | Change only if `5432` is already in use locally |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `keycloak` service | `admin` | No | `admin` is fine |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `keycloak` service | `change-me` | Yes | Any local-only value |
| `KEYCLOAK_PORT` | `deploy/compose.yml`'s `keycloak` service (host port mapping) | `8080` | No | Change only if `8080` is already in use locally |

None of these are read by the backend, transform, or frontend packages yet — only by
`deploy/compose.yml`. This table grows as later issues add services (the API, the worker,
the frontend) that read their own configuration.
